## Notes on the data

All companies, investors, founders, universities, and relationships are fictional sample data created for interface and product exploration only.

## Next steps

1. Replace the mocked dataset with a proper ingestion pipeline and persistent graph store.
2. Add timeline playback so users can watch market structure evolve over time.
3. Introduce richer relationship semantics, graph clustering, and saved views.
4. Add backend APIs, auth, and collaboration once the research workflow stabilises.
